# Overlook Hotel/Hotel Colorado
Welcome to the Hotel Colorado. You can check out any time you'd like, but you can never leave....

## Successes

1. This was the first project in Turing where there was very little guidance in what classes and methods to have, so planning and organization went a long way to getting this up and running. 
1. This site uses 100% JQuery, and 0 'vanilla' JavaScript. 
1. The Accessibility rating is 100. 

## Setup

1. Clone down this repo: `git clone [remote-address] [what you want to name the repo]`
1. Remove the default remote: `git remote rm origin` (notice that `git remote -v` not gives you back nothing)
1. Create a new repo on GitHub with the name of `[what you want to name the repo]` to be consistent with naming

Then install the library dependencies. Run:

```bash
npm install
```

## How to View The Site

In the terminal, run:

```bash
npm start
```

You will see a bunch of lines output to your terminal. One of those lines will be something like:

```bash
Project is running at http://localhost:8080/
```

Go to `http://localhost:8080/` in your browser to view your code running in the browser.


## Deploying to GitHub Pages

_If you are finished with the functionality and testing of your project_, then you can consider deploying your project to the web! This way anyone can play it without cloning down your repo.

[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) is a great way to deploy your project to the web. Don't worry about this until your project is free of bugs and well tested!

If you _are_ done, you can follow [this procedure](./gh-pages-procedure.md) to get your project live on GitHub Pages.
