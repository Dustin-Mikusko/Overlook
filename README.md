# Overlook Hotel/Hotel Colorado
Welcome to the Hotel Colorado. You can check out any time you'd like, but you can never leave....

## Successes

1. This was the first project in Turing where there was very little guidance in what classes and methods to have, so planning and organization went a long way to getting this up and running. 
1. This project utilizes the `fetch`, `fetch POST`, and `fetch DELETE` functionality.
1. The Accessibility rating is 100. 
1. The responsiveness works very well. 

## Challenges

1. Again, with this being the first project with little hand holding, deciding the class structure was very tough. 
1. This project called for using Fetch requests to get the data, so using Promises rather than local data files was a new challenge. 
1. Loading user-specific data to the page proved to be tricky.

## Setup

1. Clone down this repo: `git clone [remote-address] [what you want to name the repo]`
1. Remove the default remote: `git remote rm origin` (notice that `git remote -v` not gives you back nothing)
1. Create a new repo on GitHub with the name of `[what you want to name the repo]` to be consistent with naming

Then install the library dependencies. Run:

```bash
npm install
```

## How to View The Site

In the terminal, run:

```bash
npm start
```

You will see a bunch of lines output to your terminal. One of those lines will be something like:

```bash
Project is running at http://localhost:8080/
```

Go to `http://localhost:8080/` in your browser to view your code running in the browser.


## Deploying to GitHub Pages

_If you are finished with the functionality and testing of your project_, then you can consider deploying your project to the web! This way anyone can play it without cloning down your repo.

[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) is a great way to deploy your project to the web. Don't worry about this until your project is free of bugs and well tested!

If you _are_ done, you can follow [this procedure](./gh-pages-procedure.md) to get your project live on GitHub Pages.
